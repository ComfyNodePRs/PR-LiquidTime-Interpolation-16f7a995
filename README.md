# LiquidTime-Interpolation
LiquidTime is a simple yet powerful frame interpolation node for ComfyUI. Just input your sequence and desired frame count - the node handles all complex calculations and generates smooth in-between frames for you. A must-have tool for AI animation and video creation that lets you shape time like liquid. You can change the time curves optionally.
